# ComfyTS

## The most powerful and modular stable diffusion GUI and backend.

![ComfyUI Screenshot](comfyui_screenshot.png)

ComfyTS ("Comfy-The-Sequel" or "Comfy-TypeScript") is a fork of ComfyUI. It serves as the backend for [void.tech](https://void.tech). Project goals:

- Fix issues with ComfyUI
- Adapt ComfyUI to work in a serverless, multi-user environment more easily
- Maintain compatability with the existing ComfyUI ecosystem of custom-nodes and workflows

### Docker Instructions:

- Start your docker daemon, then in the root folder run the build command:

  `docker build -t voidtech0/comfy-ts:0.1.0 .`

Note that the docker-build does not copy the models in the docker-image (that would be stupid). Instead, it expects to load the models from an NFS-drive mounted to the container on startup.

- `docker run -it --name (???) --gpus all -p 8188:8188 -v "$(pwd)"/storage:(???)`

Other ComfyUI docker images:

- https://hub.docker.com/r/yanwk/comfyui-boot
- https://hub.docker.com/r/universonic/stable-diffusion-webui
- https://hub.docker.com/r/ashleykza/stable-diffusion-webui
- https://github.com/ai-dock/comfyui

### Docker Build Arguments

`--build-arg HEADLESS_MODE=true`: when building in headless-mode, ComfyTS will not copy over any of its UI-components, making for a smaller docker-image. This is useful when running Comfy as purely a back-end API or in a cloud-environment.

### Docker To Do:

- Make sure filesystem cache and sym-links are working.
- Do we really need the extra_model_paths?
- We probably won't need sym-links and extra-model paths anymore to be honest; we can build those into comfy-ts directly.
- Stop custom nodes from downloading external files and doing pip-install at runtime (on startup). We should ensure that's all done at build-time.
- NFS sym-links: all of ComfyUI's folders (/input, /output, /temp, /models) should be symlinked to an NFS drive, so that they can be shared amongst workers.

#### How do I share models between another UI and ComfyUI?

### General To Do:

- Add ComfyUI manager into this repo by default
- Add a startup flag to turn off the ComfyUI manager and other settings. (This is for when running ComfyTS in a cloud environment, where users downloading custom-nodes would be inappropriate.)
- Add a startup flag to switch between using ComfyUI-local or using the void-tech API

### Future

- We'll need to update the ui-tests, so that they work with importing Litegraph as a library rather than assuming it exists already in its execution context.

### Building the UI

`/web` is now a build-folder, built from `/web-src`. To recreate it, `cd` into /web-src, then run `yarn` to install dependencies, followed by `yarn build`.

#### Troubleshooting

If you get the "Torch not compiled with CUDA enabled" error, uninstall torch with:

```pip uninstall torch```

And install it again with the command above.

### Dependencies

Install the dependencies by opening your terminal inside the ComfyUI folder and:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

After this you should have everything installed and can proceed to running ComfyUI.

### Others:

#### [Intel Arc](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/discussions/476)

#### Apple Mac silicon

You can install ComfyUI in Apple Mac silicon (M1 or M2) with any recent macOS version.

1. Install pytorch nightly. For instructions, read the [Accelerated PyTorch training on Mac](https://developer.apple.com/metal/pytorch/) Apple Developer guide (make sure to install the latest pytorch nightly).
1. Follow the [ComfyUI manual installation](#manual-install-windows-linux) instructions for Windows and Linux.
1. Install the ComfyUI [dependencies](#dependencies). If you have another Stable Diffusion UI [you might be able to reuse the dependencies](#i-already-have-another-ui-for-stable-diffusion-installed-do-i-really-have-to-install-all-of-these-dependencies).
1. Launch ComfyUI by running `python main.py`

> **Note**: Remember to add your models, VAE, LoRAs etc. to the corresponding Comfy folders, as discussed in [ComfyUI manual installation](#manual-install-windows-linux).

#### DirectML (AMD Cards on Windows)

```pip install torch-directml``` Then you can launch ComfyUI with: ```python main.py --directml```

### I already have another UI for Stable Diffusion installed do I really have to install all of these dependencies?

You don't. If you have another UI installed and working with its own python venv you can use that venv to run ComfyUI. You can open up your favorite terminal and activate it:

```source path_to_other_sd_gui/venv/bin/activate```

or on Windows:

With Powershell: ```"path_to_other_sd_gui\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1"```

With cmd.exe: ```"path_to_other_sd_gui\venv\Scripts\activate.bat"```

And then you can use that terminal to run ComfyUI without installing any dependencies. Note that the venv folder might be called something else depending on the SD UI.

# Running

```python main.py```

### For AMD cards not officially supported by ROCm

Try running it with this command if you have issues:

For 6700, 6600 and maybe other RDNA2 or older: ```HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=10.3.0 python main.py```

For AMD 7600 and maybe other RDNA3 cards: ```HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=11.0.0 python main.py```

# Notes

Only parts of the graph that have an output with all the correct inputs will be executed.

Only parts of the graph that change from each execution to the next will be executed, if you submit the same graph twice only the first will be executed. If you change the last part of the graph only the part you changed and the part that depends on it will be executed.

Dragging a generated png on the webpage or loading one will give you the full workflow including seeds that were used to create it.

You can use () to change emphasis of a word or phrase like: (good code:1.2) or (bad code:0.8). The default emphasis for () is 1.1. To use () characters in your actual prompt escape them like \\( or \\).

You can use {day|night}, for wildcard/dynamic prompts. With this syntax "{wild|card|test}" will be randomly replaced by either "wild", "card" or "test" by the frontend every time you queue the prompt. To use {} characters in your actual prompt escape them like: \\{ or \\}.

Dynamic prompts also support C-style comments, like `// comment` or `/* comment */`.

To use a textual inversion concepts/embeddings in a text prompt put them in the models/embeddings directory and use them in the CLIPTextEncode node like this (you can omit the .pt extension):

```embedding:embedding_filename.pt```


## How to increase generation speed?

Make sure you use the regular loaders/Load Checkpoint node to load checkpoints. It will auto pick the right settings depending on your GPU.

You can set this command line setting to disable the upcasting to fp32 in some cross attention operations which will increase your speed. Note that this will very likely give you black images on SD2.x models. If you use xformers or pytorch attention this option does not do anything.

```--dont-upcast-attention```

## How to show high-quality previews?

Use ```--preview-method auto``` to enable previews.

The default installation includes a fast latent preview method that's low-resolution. To enable higher-quality previews with [TAESD](https://github.com/madebyollin/taesd), download the [taesd_decoder.pth](https://github.com/madebyollin/taesd/raw/main/taesd_decoder.pth) (for SD1.x and SD2.x) and [taesdxl_decoder.pth](https://github.com/madebyollin/taesd/raw/main/taesdxl_decoder.pth) (for SDXL) models and place them in the `models/vae_approx` folder. Once they're installed, restart ComfyUI to enable high-quality previews.

# QA

### Why did you make this?

I wanted to learn how Stable Diffusion worked in detail. I also wanted something clean and powerful that would let me experiment with SD without restrictions.

### Who is this for?

This is for anyone that wants to make complex workflows with SD or that wants to learn more how SD works. The interface follows closely how SD works and the code should be much more simple to understand than other SD UIs.
